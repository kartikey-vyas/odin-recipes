        <li>3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for baking sheet</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1½ cup (102 g) panko</li>
        <li>½ cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp. garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp. oregano</li>
        <li>2 oz. Parmesan, finely grated (about ½ cup), plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 lb. ground beef (20% fat) or other ground meat, divided</li>
        <li>Warm <a href="./marinara-sauce.html">homemade tomato sauce</a> or store-bought marinara and torn basil leaves (for serving)</li>
    </ul>        

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Place rack in top third of oven; preheat oven to 425°. Lightly brush a large rimmed baking sheet with extra-virgin olive oil. Using a sturdy wooden spoon, vigorously stir 2 large eggs, 1½ cup (102 g) panko, ½ cup whole milk, 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. oregano, 2 oz. Parmesan, finely grated (about ½ cup), remaining 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, and several cranks of freshly ground black pepper in a large bowl until nearly a smooth paste. Let the mixture rest for 10 minutes. Mix in a quarter of 1 lb. ground beef (20% fat) or other ground meat (combining just a small amount of meat first makes it easier to incorporate the rest without overmixing). Add remaining ground beef and mix well to thoroughly combine, but don’t overwork it. Using oiled hands, divide meat mixture into eighths; form into 8 large meatballs and place on prepared baking sheet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake meatballs until well-browned underneath, about 15 minutes. Using a stiff metal spatula, pry up and turn over meatballs (they may want to stick a bit). Bake until browned on second side and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of each one registers 160°, 5–7 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Divide meatballs among plates and spoon warm tomato sauce over. Top with torn basil leaves and more Parmesan.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Do Ahead:</strong> Meatballs can be baked 3 days ahead. Cool, then chill; reheat in an oven set to 325° or simmer in sauce until warmed through, 10–15 minutes.</p>
